# üè° AirBNB Amsterdam Data Cleaning & Exploration üè∞

In this project I will be cleaning & analyzing data regarding the listings of AirBNB in Amsterdam and their reviews.
The data was compiled on September 7th, 2022.

  In the file 'PART1-data-cleaning-sql' I will be using SQL queries to clean Amsterdam's AirBNB listing data.
The data can be found in the excel file 'PART1-listings-data-for-cleaning'.


## PART 2 
  In the file 'PART2-data-exploration-sql' I will be using SQL queries to explore Amsterdam's AirBNB listing & review data,
